## Heart Disease Risk Assessment: A Machine Learning Approach
**Team Members:** Minju Kim, Ling Li, Lei Chen

### Project Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for our project titled "Heart Disease Risk Assessment: A Machine Learning Approach." Our project aims to utilize advanced machine learning techniques to analyze and predict heart disease risks, with a particular focus on gender-specific factors.

### Repository Contents

- `final-nk159-lli4-lc51.pdf`: Our final report for this project in the Final Report file.

- `final_mk159_lli4_lc51.ipynb`: on final_mk159_lli4_lc51 file, Our main Jupyter notebook containing the cleaned and commented code for the project. This notebook provides an in-depth look at our data analysis and machine learning model development process.

- `Ensemble_adaboost`: A folder containing code for our ensemble model approach using Adaboost. This code was executed on the BigRed supercomputer for enhanced computational power and efficiency.

- `MidTerm_Kim_Li_Chen.pdf`: The midterm proposal for our project, outlining our initial hypotheses, objectives, and research methodology.

### Data Source
Our analysis is based on a dataset obtained from Kaggle, specifically focusing on cardiovascular disease. The dataset can be accessed through the following link: [Kaggle Cardiovascular Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/colewelkins/cardiovascular-disease/data).
